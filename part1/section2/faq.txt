In the computer science, Abstraction is used to separate ideas from their implementation.
Abstraction in java is used to define only ideas in one class so that the idea can be implemented by its sub classes
according to their requirements

B40:
Can an abstract class have a constructor?
yes, to call super class constructor

B48:
no we can't have constructor in an interface, why bcz constructor is used to initialize the instance variable stored in an object.
Constructor is called concurrently while creating object. We can't create object to interface & also we can't provide instance
variable to interface. So we can't use constructor in an interface 

B49:
Since purpose of interface is to provide a mechanism where users/implementors of the interface can implement the properties( methods)
according to their needs. But if i am allowed to add implementation in interface then some how that purpose of interface is defeated
